This application asks contributors to search through Swiss archaeological
fieldwork reports for mention of radiocarbon dates. Lists of such
dates have become increasingly useful to researchers,
above and beyond their immediate role in providing an absolute chronology
for a particular archaeological site. Some people have used them to
model the appearance or disappearance in human history of certain categories of
historical monument more accurately, others to reconstruct past
regional population highs and lows, others to consider patterns of
climate change, and others to understand society's changing emphasis on different
foodstuffs.

Over the last 25 years, there has been an explosion of archaeological
fieldwork in advance of modern development projects (e.g. road
building, house construction, retail outlets, train lines etc.). This
has produced vast amounts of new evidence and a very large number of
published reports about archaeological sites, including many that
contain radiocarbon dates.  In this project we seek to extract radiocarbon
data from reports from Switerland (potentially in French, German, Italian or English), but in principle the same approach might allow us
collectively to enhance the value of these reports in all sorts of
other important ways.

For this particular project, we have already conducted a first check
of several groups of open access reports from the Swiss e-periodica
journal portal and identified those reports
that are very likely to contain radiocarbon dates. Although a few may
have no useful details, most should do. We now ask for your help with searching
inside a particular report and entering any dates you find into a
database in a systematic way. As always, any such contributions will
themselves also be made publicly available.
